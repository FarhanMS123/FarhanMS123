Yeah it is not my real name. But if novelist and cartoonist can have pen name, why programmer cannot have a `cursor name`? :D Aha? Especially, a pen name is also a symbolization which describe their own pride.

Okay, hear me out. So, now, what do you think of cat? A creative dirty creature? A lazy animal being? Or an ignorance about everything even their know it’s human warning, but also know when to comfort it’s human. This is truly inspire me, a very weird-energetic-curious creature in the purest evilest-sweet-angelic form.

So, kindly introduce, Felis Cato. A creative mindset, and also always has a way to solve every struggle. I’m not seeing them as lazy or ignorance, but I see a very discipline about their time and know when to stop, resting, and recharge their energy. As Its creativeness and curiosity, challenge is something fun, but still know how to prioritize. Prideness, maybe it is a negative words as it leads to abusive power. But for me, this could lead to positiveness. As a cat seems to looks royal to its self, they are also grown, in the wild, to be responsible to what they have and what must be organized.

Oh, oh! Cat is also has a sharp intuitive, temperament (as its energetic), and rebel (as its curiosity). Well… every opportunity also has its drawbacks. So, yeah, I always think to never hold yourself. Do what you think it is best to do, but also try to listen to everyone. Summarize every suggestion, then create a unified, a perfect collective opinion, which is best for everyone.
